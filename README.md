# ButtonKeys
Tiny arduino sketch to have foot switches generate key presses. I built this for for leaning in pubg :-)

## Parts used
 * Arduino Pro Micro board like https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01D0OI90U/ - € 9.99
 * Two foot switches  like https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00ORYD4MQ/ - € 13.99 each
 * Lego for the case :)
 
The switches are quite pricey, but they sport a heavy base with rubber pieces so they don't slide around. Also the actual switches are microswitches, so you have clear feedback when the switch engages.

## Final product
(Second image NSFDIYers, as the soldering and overall wiring is hilariously bad)
